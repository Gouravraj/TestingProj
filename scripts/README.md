### Extract app package from simulator, emulator (.app, .apk)

You must put file(s) inside `/path/current_repo/app`. Like `./app/app-debug.apk`. Or, you can put file(s) manually.

You can extract app package direct from simulator by `extract-pkg`. [Github](https://github.com/jsveron23/extract-pkg)

To extract, simulator already booted and should be installed package on that. then,

```bash
extract-pkg ios -id=com.cxagroup.mobile.EmployeePortal --to=./app --rename=app-debug.app
```

The scripts to be handled by NPM scripts. You should open one of simulator which already installed app package. (`./scripts/config.js#pkg`)

```bash
npm run pkg # extract both platforms
npm run pkg:ios
npm run pkg:android
```
